            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>When I was a kid, I liked to play with some childhood friends and go around the vicinity of our hometown.
                <sup>2</sup> We would wander around, climb trees, and mountains because our area—being near a mountain—didn’t really have access to gadgets, like phones and Wi-Fi connections, just yet.
                <sup>3</sup> We only knew of boxed televisions, cellular phones like Nokia and Blackberry mobile, and some portable consoles like PSP and Nintendo.
                <sup>4</sup> I would play with them and share it with my friends, because the majority of them were new to that kind of technology and I was the only one who had it at that time.
                <sup>5</sup> We only played during weekends, because we had classes during weekdays.
                <sup>6</sup> And during my elementary school days, I would go play with my classmates.
                <sup>7</sup> Learning when I was still in elementary was fun. 
                <sup>8</sup>because I wasn’t frustrated with the subjects or getting low grades that time.
                <sup>9</sup> When it’s time to go home, my mother or my grandparents would fetch me in school or sometimes, 
                <sup>10</sup> my service would take me home.
                <sup>11</sup> My lola would always give me money when it’s saturday and take me to places i have never been before.
                <sup>12</sup> She would sometimes take me out late at night with my cousins and we would watch some boring politics running at the time.
                <sup>13</sup> And we would get free food and stuff.
                <sup>14</sup> Moreover, I enjoyed joining in extracurricular activities such as quiz bees, spelling bees, and other activities at school.
                <sup>15</sup> I was a very active student; I even considered myself as a somewhat “prodigy” child because at an early age, I never really engaged in childish fights and arguments.
                <sup>16</sup> I even considered myself as a somewhat “prodigy” child because at an early age, I never really engaged in childish fights and arguments.
                <sup>17</sup> I dealt with my emotions maturely and in a mannerful way, unlike other children my age that were throwing tantrums.
                <sup>18</sup> I was also a very obedient child, I would always listen to my parents and my grandparents.
                <sup>19</sup> I would always listen to my parents and my grandparents.
                <sup>20</sup> I was a very good child, and I was very proud of myself for being one.

            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My teenage years were an eye-opener for me as I was introduced to new stuff and a new perspective in life. I enjoyed my teenage life;
                <sup>2</sup> I was able to experience doing research, doing mathematical equations, and developed my self-discipline.
                <sup>3</sup> Yes, at some point, it got tough, as I experienced one of the downfalls of my life and one of the unsettling things I experienced.
                <sup>4</sup> It developed my personal skills and my socialization skills as I had many friends during my teenage years.
                <sup>5</sup> It was very fun that I was able to meet new people and bond with them, to nurture everything whilst it lasted and to cherish everything that I had back then.
                <sup>6</sup> It was the time I also learned to drive and had a license to drive.
                <sup>7</sup> It was one of my privileges in my early teenage life because I was one of the earliest to have a license around 17 years old.
                <sup>8</sup> Of Course my mom was very supportive of me having a license as it eases our transportation problems.
                <sup>9</sup> And also since my school back then was an international school i experienced having a work-immersion outside the country.
                <sup>10</sup> It was very memorable for me because it’s my first time going outside the country with my classmates to learn other cultures, other languages and to teach our cultures as well.
                <sup>11</sup> And to go to places or attractions in that country.
                <sup>12</sup> It was also my first time to be an intern as I was part of my local red cross, and I was the data encoder there.
                <sup>13</sup> It was my first time also to be able to use Microsoft Excel, and to talk to other people.
                <sup>14</sup> It was also the time that I became a volunteer as I was deployed to neighboring communities. 
                <sup>15</sup> and it was a privilege to help other people who are in need.
                <sup>16</sup> I also started my business with buy and sell and also franchising.
                <sup>17</sup> I was able to buy everything I needed without the burden of my parents always providing for me. 
                <sup>18</sup> but I had to stop it as college was approaching.
                <sup>19</sup> Speaking of college, it was the time that I also enrolled in universities;
                <sup>20</sup> like PUP, CEU, NU, DLSU, LSPU, FEU and UE.

            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>In my college years, I enrolled in University of the East.
                <sup>2</sup> I was very excited and nervous at the same time because it's my first time to live in Manila 
                <sup>3</sup> independently and my first time that I would handle myself on my own.
                <sup>4</sup> At first, it was hard because if I need something before it’s easy access as I am within reach with my family 
                <sup>5</sup> but now it’s not, as I need to take care of myself.
                <sup>6</sup> I experienced going to places I have never been before, meeting other people, and discovering many things
                <sup>7</sup> like—you can eat raw corned beef as it was already cooked.
                <sup>8</sup> It was hard for me to adjust on the surroundings and adjust on the places as it was a fresh start
                <sup>9</sup> and it feels like I started a new chapter in my life.
                <sup>10</sup> I had also learned many things about computer studies and information technology like working on websites, databases and simple programming and as I progress my IT Studies
                <sup>11</sup> and my course in the near future I would be interested in pursuing what suits me in the IT field.
                <sup>12</sup> Learning and Mastering skills in the IT profession and field is one of my main goals
                <sup>13</sup> because my father is an IT himself, he works in an international bank company with a high position
                <sup>14</sup> and that serves as an inspiration for myself to gain more knowledge and able to show myself that i can be like him and better than him.
                <sup>15</sup> I also met other people like an official and big-time person who owns a business or a tycoon in the Philippines.
                <sup>16</sup> I was also invited to some forums in some universities like UP-Diliman and UST.
                <sup>17</sup> I learned a lot as I gathered perspectives of people who are successful, who are studying for the future.
                <sup>18</sup> It was a privilege for me to study in one of the competing universities in the Philippines
                <sup>19</sup> it was a privilege to study in the University of the East.
                <sup>20</sup> I am very grateful for the opportunity that I was able to study in UE.
